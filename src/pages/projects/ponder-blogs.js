            Ponder Blogs was a destination site where anyone could read the
            public content authored with Ponder.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-2 sm:pb-4">
            Powered by NextJS, the Ponder Blogs was a mixture of SSR (servier
            side rendered) and SSG (statically generated) content, making it
            blazingly fast while still allowing for having dynamic elements and
            instant publishing as well as advanced features like allowing
            authors to choose theme and layout variations.

            I was in charge of development, while the beautiful design was the

        Perhaps this is better explained through example: NextJS is an amazing
        framework. After writing the Ponder client in standalone react, writing
        the blogs site with Next was a revelation. It allowed me to build fast
        and focus on the important aspects of the product. As we were beginning
        to build, Next released a new feature called Incremental Static
        Regeneration (ISR), which did on-the-fly static site generation at
        request time instead of compile time. It was way faster than SSR, worked
        like magic and had minimal setup. Unfortunately our feature-set included
        the ability for authors to change the theme of their site, and there was
        no way of making that feature &quot;feel&quot; right with ISR, since one
        couldn&apos;t invalidate the existing cache across all the blog&apos;s
        pages at once. It was a painful but right decision to use SSR instead no
        matter how much I wanted to use ISR. (someday I&apos;m sure they will
        introduce partial cache invalidation).

        In a way I think both me and Dave (co-founder) really like polished
        experiences (in design and code respectively). This being our company
        and it being a startup we learned that good and working is better than
        perfect and under development. This also led me to develop better
        practices of incremental refactoring.

        The drive to rewrite something is especially strong when you are new at
        something. You&apos;re learning so much so fast that pretty soon you
        realize you could&apos;ve done things so much better. This feeling felt
        like trap, what is paramount is results in the form of having a working
        product. However, I got much better at achieving the same result by
        instead doing incremental refactoring which helped me keep the speed of
        development while also increasing stability.

        Another example: Even in a development team of one I sometimes faced the
        issue of wanting to change the way I did something, either stylistically
        or syntactically, because I learned new things or people showed me
        better ways of expressing things. When you&apos;re iterating fast
        though, I found 99% of the time it&apos;s better to stick to a correct
        (if not perfect) set of rules, have a linter enforce them and just
        forget about it.

        Last but probably the most valuable lesson for me was that it is not
        enough for me to maintain my mindfulness practice as my work volume
        fluctuates, it is imperative that my practice grows proportional to it.
        There&apos;s a certain momentum (what I&apos;ve heard being referred to
        as &apos;codebrain&apos;) that my mind builds when programming that if
        left unchecked will continue on and bleed into the rest of my day, which
        results in a too active mind, less clarity and less sleep, which in turn
        can hurt the work. Ironically, I&apos;ve found it&apos;s especially
        necessary for me to do this when the work is fun (and it almost always
        does). I learned to stop every so often and take some time to meditate,
        then go back to work or go back about my day.
