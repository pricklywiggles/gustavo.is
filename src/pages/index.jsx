              I&lsquo;m a developer specializing in Javascript, React and GraphQL and currently
              living in Los Angeles. I&lsquo;ve loved technology since I was very young. I remember
              when I was a 15 year old kid living in Guadalajara I somehow convinced my parents to
              buy me an IBM PS/2 desktop so I could try some Basic and C++ programming. A technician
              came to your house to install it, as was common back then, and I stood right next to
              him memorizing the commands he typed into the DOS prompt. By the time he left I
              thought to myself &quot;That didn&lsquo;t look so hard&quot;, so I sat down and typed
              my very first computer command...
              <code className="block mx-auto text-sm my-4  font-code w-max px-4 py-1 rounded-md p- bg-gray-800 text-gray-300 uppercase">
                C&gt; format c:
                <span className="r animate-pulse">_</span>
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              And thus began a long sequence of learning opportunities that continue to this day. By
              the time I went to high school I had taught myself C and C++. I soon left Mexico for
              the US to get a CS degree and later began my career as a developer at Microsoft before
              moving to the Bay Area to work helping startups grow several times their size,
              including a stint as Director of QA at Max Levchin&lsquo;s Slide and later as the
              Technical Program Manager for the Health division of Jawbone. It was rewarding work,
              but I missed the feeling of finding elegant solutions to problems through code.

              In 2018 I decided to jump back into development by co-founding the company behind
              ponder.to, a group blogging platform we recently had to shutter. As difficult as it
              was to get back to speed after not coding for a long time, I loved every minute of it.
